## Plugins
Revaco uses many plugins to have one configuration and not many seperate plugins.

There are some facts about them:
- There is a "Main Switch" for every Plugin
- Plugin JS will only be loaded if active
- If there are configurations for the plugin, they are saved in the details.xml
- The config can be overriden for every single call
- Plugins are used by assining classes to a container (p,div,...)
- The content and (maybe) config are plain written in the container
- There are global plugins (like lazyload) and local ones (like youtube)

## Planed Additional Projects

- Version for Wordpress
- Version for Tools with XML-Config-File (Navigation?)
